The repeated `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'MDAnalysis'` means the core package is not being built or installed, due to repeated errors during compilation (likely C code compilation). This is a compiled/scientific Python package; such packages require native build tools, particularly a C compiler and Python dev headers.

**Action:**  
Install essential build tools and Python development headers, which are required to compile Cython/C-extensions.

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev
pip install ./package
pytest
```
