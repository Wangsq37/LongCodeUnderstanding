The main error from `pytest` is:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'MDAnalysis'
```

This means the MDAnalysis package wasn't installed successfully in editable mode (`pip install -e ./package` failed due to a Cython/compilation/build error).

Before going further, I'll make some adjustments:

- Try a regular install (not editable) to see if the tests can then find the package.
- If that fails with compilation errors again, try a minimal install using just the build system, or confirm Cython/build tools are present.
- Ensure we have basic build tools (some packages such as MDAnalysis need them).
- Retry pytest after any installation.

Here's my plan:
1. Install Cython explicitly again and retry a non-editable install of MDAnalysis.
2. If there are still compilation errors, investigate whether necessary build tools (gcc, etc.) are present.
3. If compilation succeeds, rerun pytest.

```bash
pip install cython
pip install ./package
pytest
