Despite adjusting PYTHONPATH, `pytest` still cannot import `pycuda` because it requires C extensions to be compiled, and the compilation fails due to missing system files (`pyconfig.h`) and the CUDA toolkit (`nvcc`).

You cannot proceed to test collection without a successful build of the `pycuda` package, and as shown above, the installation cannot proceed due to missing compilation dependencies.

Therefore, Phase 1 cannot be completed successfully in this container as currently configured.
