The key error is:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pycuda'
```
This means that the tests are looking for the `pycuda` package, but it is not installed as an importable package in the Python environment.

From the previous pip install log:
- The `pip install .` step tried to build the local `pycuda` but failed **because of missing CUDA and not having run `configure.py`**.

To allow the tests to run (even if they will fail at runtime due to missing CUDA), I will:
1. Try to run the provided `configure.py` script, which is specifically mentioned as necessary in the pycuda error message and README_SETUP.txt.
2. Re-attempt to install the local package with `pip install .`.

Let's proceed.

```bash
python configure.py
pip install .
pytest
```
