The problem remains: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pycuda'`

Attempts to install via `pip install .` fail because building the C++ extension requires headers (`pyconfig.h`), and probably the CUDA toolkit (`nvcc` is not in path). Without these, the package can't install and the module isn't available for import.

**Options to workaround for basic test collection:**
- Add the `pycuda` directory to `PYTHONPATH` so Python can find it as a namespace package (even if some runtime errors occur later).

Let me try setting the environment so Python can import the source tree directly, and see if pytest can proceed past collection:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/app/repo_to_process/pycuda"
pytest
```
If this fails again with the same error (because `pycuda` can't be found or Python doesn't recognize `pycuda` as a proper package), there's no way to get past test collection errors without a successful build. If the tests require compiled extensions, but these cannot be built due to missing system dependencies (like CUDA and Python/C++ dev headers), the environment is not sufficent.

Trying this step before declaring failure.
