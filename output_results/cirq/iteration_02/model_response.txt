The error output shows pip is failing to build the packages in editable mode due to a version check in the Cirq source code:
```
SystemError: You installed the latest version of Cirq but aren't on Python 3.11+.
To fix this error, you need to either:

A) Update to Python 3.11 or later.
- OR -
B) Explicitly install an older deprecated-but-compatible version of Cirq (e.g. "python -m pip install cirq==1.5.0")
```
This means **Cirq now requires Python 3.11+ for its main/HEAD version**.

You are running **Python 3.10**, so the `setup.py` and `_version.py` scripts in every Cirq package (core, google, etc) refuse to install.

At this stage, **it is not possible to run or collect tests for this repository with Python 3.10**, due to hardcoded upstream version checks.

If you want to test this HEAD version of Cirq, you MUST upgrade to Python 3.11 or later.

Otherwise, you would have to "pin" to older Cirq releases for each subpackage (not viable for this monorepo HEAD/development environment).

Therefore:

```status
failed
```
