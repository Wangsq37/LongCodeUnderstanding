Based on the dependency info from `setup.py`, `climlab` requires:

- numpy
- xarray
- scipy

No other main runtime dependencies are listed.

To ensure a clean environment, let's install these dependencies explicitly.

Also, while the `setup_requires` and `install_requires` are present, installing via `pip install .` or with `pip install -e .` would install them, but in testing containers it's safer to pin the runtime dependencies first (since we do not need to build extensions, only to ensure imports for tests).

Let's proceed to install the core dependencies and then run `pytest`. If there are further `ModuleNotFoundError` problems during test collection, we will install those missing packages as we encounter them.

```bash
pip install numpy xarray scipy
pytest
```
