First, let's analyze the dependency files present in the root of the project:

- `setup.py` (present)
- `pyproject.toml` (present)
- `environment.yml` (present)

To ensure coverage, let's check the content of `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` to determine the dependencies specified. I'll look for runtime requirements (install_requires, etc.) in `setup.py` and `[build-system]/[project]/[tool.poetry]/[tool.flit]` etc. in `pyproject.toml`.

Let's start by viewing relevant sections.

```bash
head -40 setup.py
head -40 pyproject.toml
```
