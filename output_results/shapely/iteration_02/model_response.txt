The root problem is that `pip install -e .` failed to build the package because of C extension build issues:
- It could not find `Python.h`: this means Python development headers are missing.
- It also warned about `geos-config` not being found: so the GEOS C library and headers are missing, but the immediate error is about Python headers.

**Resolution:**  
First, install the Python development headers (for Python 3.10).
Then, install GEOS development headers (required by Shapely).

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3.10-dev libgeos-dev
# Now retry editable install
pip install -e .
# And retry pytest
pytest
```
