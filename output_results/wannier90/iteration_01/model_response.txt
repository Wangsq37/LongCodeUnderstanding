```bash
# Step 1: Find dependency files in the project root and relevant subdirectories.
ls -l requirements.txt setup.py pyproject.toml
ls -l docs/requirements.txt
ls -l test-suite/
ls -l src/
ls -l wrap/
ls -l utility/

# Step 2: Install dependencies from the most likely requirement files.
# Prioritize project root, then docs/.
# The main Python code seems to be under test-suite/tools/parsers/, utility/, wrap/, etc.
# Install requirements from docs/requirements.txt if it exists.
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

# Step 3: Try running pytest to check for missing dependencies and test collection.
pytest
```
