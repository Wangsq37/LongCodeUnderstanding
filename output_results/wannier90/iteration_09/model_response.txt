Based on the project structure, it appears that there are no actual Python source files in `src/`, only Fortran and header files. The real location for Python code (if any) must be elsewhere.

The most promising candidate for Python source is the `docs/docs/parameters/` directory, which contains at least one Python file: `generate-parameter-tables.py`. There may also be tests targeting this script.

It's possible that the test discovery is not working because:
- There are no Python test files present (e.g., `test_*.py` or in a `tests/`/`test-suite/` directory).
- The provided test-suite contains only non-Python artifacts for regression or input-data tests.

Given that, let's try tracking the most probable Python-containing directory:  
- `docs/docs/parameters`

So I will set up tracing for that:

```file:conftest.py
SOURCE_DIRS_TO_TRACK = ['docs/docs/parameters']
```
```bash
pytest
```

If the test count remains zero, it likely means there are truly no pytest-compatible Python tests in this project.
If so, this repo is probably Fortran-based, with only minor auxiliary Python scripts.

If after this final attempt there are still zero tests and zero call chain reports, the correct status is:

```status
failed
```
