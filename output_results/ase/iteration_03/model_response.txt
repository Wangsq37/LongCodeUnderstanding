# The error remains: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'

# The package 'tk' from pip is NOT the real tkinter GUI library; tkinter is a standard library shipped with Python, but in Linux-based containers,
# you must install the system package (e.g., python3-tk, or sometimes tkinter) via OS package manager (apt, yum, etc.).
# pip install tk does NOT solve this issue.

# Since the environment only allows running pip (not OS package managers like apt),
# it is NOT possible to install the actual tkinter module required for these tests through pip.

# Phase 1 cannot be completed in this environment.
