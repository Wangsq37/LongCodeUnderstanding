```bash
# 1. Install dependencies listed in pyproject.toml and setup.py (likely a scientific/ASE package).
# Since both files exist, try pip install using editable mode to ensure local source is used and all dependencies are pulled.
pip install -e . 

# 2. Run pytest and check for collection errors.
pytest
