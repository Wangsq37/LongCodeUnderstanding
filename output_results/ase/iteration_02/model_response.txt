```bash
# The error is: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'
# Solution: Install the tkinter package for Python 3.10.
# On Debian/Ubuntu-based distros, this is usually python3-tk, but in many environments pip cannot install it
# because it is a system package (not a pip package).

# Try pip install first, but if it doesn't work, you must state in the next step that tkinter must be installed via OS tools.

pip install tk
# Then, retry pytest to check if the error resolves.
pytest
