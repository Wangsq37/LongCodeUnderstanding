The issue is:
```
ERROR: Package '21cmfast' requires a different Python: 3.10.12 not in '>=3.11'
```
The package requires Python >=3.11, but the environment is running Python 3.10.12.

This is a fundamental incompatibility; the package cannot be installed or its code imported/tested under the current Python version.
