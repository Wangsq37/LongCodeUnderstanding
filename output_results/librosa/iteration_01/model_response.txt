```bash
# Step 1: Prefer modern builds: use pyproject.toml if complete, otherwise setup.py/setup.cfg.
# Let's review possible dependency sources in priority:

# Review pyproject.toml for [build-system], [project], [tool.poetry], or [tool.pdm]
cat pyproject.toml

# If no clear dependencies in pyproject.toml, review setup.py for install_requires
cat setup.py

# If still unclear, check for requirements.txt
if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then cat requirements.txt; fi

# See if there are any environment files in .github/ that cover main dependencies
ls .github | grep environment

# Now proceed with the practical install, pip prefers build-system > setup.py > requirements.txt

# Install with pip and fallback options:
pip install . || pip install -e . || pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 2: Try to run pytest (it may already have its own tests/conftest.py)
pytest
```
