The underlying issue is still a persistent `502 Bad Gateway` error from the Ubuntu mirrors while fetching required system packages (e.g., `libxcomposite1` this time, after previously failing at `libtext-iconv-perl`). This makes `apt-get install nodejs npm` impossible, which in turn prevents a successful build and pip install of the Python package (because Bokeh requires building JS assets).

Without the successful installation of these system dependencies, proceeding further in Phase 1 is not possible. The recurring mirror/network issue is not something I can resolve internally in the container.
