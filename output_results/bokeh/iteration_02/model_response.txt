The core issue is that the package build failed because the `bokeh` package in this repo requires a JavaScript build step ("Building BokehJS") that tries to run `node make build`, but Node.js (`node`) is not installed in the container.

This means:
- The Python package (`bokeh`) was not built or installed, so `pytest` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bokeh'` on import.
- The solution is to install Node.js, then re-run `pip install .`.

Let's fix this!

```bash
# Install Node.js (to make 'node' available for the JavaScript build step)
apt-get update
apt-get install -y nodejs npm

# Try pip install . again now that Node is available
pip install .
```

Once this succeeds, we will re-run pytest.
