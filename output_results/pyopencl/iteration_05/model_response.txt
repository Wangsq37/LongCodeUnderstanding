The error remains:

```
pyopencl._cl.LogicError: clGetPlatformIDs failed: PLATFORM_NOT_FOUND_KHR
```

There was no ImportError, missing Python package, or anything that can be resolved by `pip install`. The issue is strictly that there is no OpenCL platform available in the environmentâ€”an unavoidable hardware or driver limitation in the current Docker setup.

`pocl` (a possible solution) is not available as a PyPI package and cannot be installed with pip.

**Based on typical PyOpenCL behavior:**
- The test suite cannot be collected without a working OpenCL ICD/platform.
- The collection phase will always error until hardware or software OpenCL support is present.

I cannot proceed to Phase 2 as the success condition for Phase 1 ("pytest can collect tests") cannot be met.
