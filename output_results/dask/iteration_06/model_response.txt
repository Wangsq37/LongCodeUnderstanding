Since `import dask.tests` works with PYTHONPATH set, but pytest still crashes with the warning filter referring to `dask.tests.warning_aliases.RemovedIn20Warning`, it is possible this is an incompatibility between pytest and the project's warning configurations, or that the dask source tree's `conftest.py` (found at `dask/conftest.py`) is being auto-detected and misapplied when tests are run from the repo root.

Let's try to run pytest explicitly in the dask directory instead of repo root. That is, from the repo root run:

```bash
pytest dask
```

If this doesn't work, let's try running only a simple test file (e.g., just the tests in `dask/tests/test_base.py`) to see if the warning configuration triggers only for some combinations.

```bash
pytest dask/tests/test_base.py
```

If either command allows the test collection phase to complete, that will pinpoint how to proceed.
