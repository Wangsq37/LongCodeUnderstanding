There was no missing dependency; instead, the error is:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dask.tests'
ERROR: while parsing the following warning configuration:
  ignore:.*:dask.tests.warning_aliases.RemovedIn20Warning
```

This is a warning filter that references `dask.tests.warning_aliases.RemovedIn20Warning`, but the import fails. This typically happens if the working directory isn't on `PYTHONPATH`.

The fix is to ensure the source tree is discoverable. This can usually be done by setting the `PYTHONPATH` to the project root.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
pytest
```
This should allow `pytest` to find `dask.tests` and run.
