The error is still:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dask.tests'
ERROR: while parsing the following warning configuration:

  ignore:.*:dask.tests.warning_aliases.RemovedIn20Warning
```

This is not a package missing from PyPI, but rather that `dask.tests` (directory: `dask/tests/`) is not importable in the context that the warning filter is being parsed. Two possible causes:

1. The working directory is not on the module search path, or
2. The import machinery cannot resolve relative to the repo root.

**Attempts to fix:**
- `PYTHONPATH` already set to repo root.
- Still fails.

#### Is `dask.tests` importable in this environment with Python?

Let's check if `dask.tests` can be imported:

```bash
python -c "import dask.tests"
```
If this fails, the problem is import resolution. If it succeeds, something else is wrong.
