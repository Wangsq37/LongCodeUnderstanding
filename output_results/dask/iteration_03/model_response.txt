The error is:

```
ERROR collecting dask - _pytest.pathlib.ImportPathMismatchError: ('dask.conftest', '/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/dask/conftest.py', PosixPath('/app/repo_to_process/dask/conftest.py'))
```

This is a conftest clash between the installed package and the local source tree:
- `/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/dask/conftest.py` (likely from previous pip installs)
- `/app/repo_to_process/dask/conftest.py` (local source)

Pytest gets confused when a package is both installed and in the test root tree. The recommended fix is to uninstall the `dask` package so only the local copy is used.

```bash
pip uninstall -y dask
pytest
```
If other packages (e.g., `distributed`) cause the same error due to local source, they may also need to be uninstalled. Let's try with `dask` first.
