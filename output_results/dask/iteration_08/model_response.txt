Pytest successfully collected 14882 items, but there were 4 errors due to "Unknown pytest.mark.flaky". This means the tests use a custom `flaky` mark, but the required plugin is not installed.

You need to install the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin, which provides the `flaky` mark.

```bash
pip install pytest-rerunfailures
```

Then, rerun:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest dask
```

If collection errors persist, share only the new error output. If collection is successful and errors disappear, Phase 1 is complete.
