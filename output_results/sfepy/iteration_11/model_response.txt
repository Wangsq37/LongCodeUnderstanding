The error is:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'skbuild'
```

This is a missing build dependency needed by the setup script. Install `scikit-build`.

```bash
pip install scikit-build
```
After this, rerun the build command:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
Then rerun `pytest` to check if the `cmapping` extension is built and installed.
