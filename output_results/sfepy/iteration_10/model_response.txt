The error persists:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sfepy.discrete.common.extmods.cmapping'
```

Despite installing in editable mode, the C-extension `cmapping` was not built/found. This is a classic problem with Python packages using C extensions when the build step does not succeed or isn't triggered correctly.

**Diagnosis:**  
- `sfepy/discrete/common/extmods/` exists, but cmapping is not found.
- Editable install via pip did not build or install the extension (may require CMake/ninja presence, or manual build step).
- `_skbuild/linux-x86_64-3.10/cmake-build/sfepy` exists, possible build output directory from scikit-build, but may not be installed.

**Next step:**  
Try a direct build using `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` to explicitly build extensions, then rerun pytest.

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
pytest
```
