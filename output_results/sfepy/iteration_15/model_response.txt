The `pytest` output shows multiple `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sfepy.discrete.common.extmods.cmapping'`. This is not a PyPI package, but a Cython extension that the build process failed to produce, likely due to missing Cython.

The critical line in the error output:
```
CMake Error at /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/skbuild/resources/cmake/FindCython.cmake:71 (message):
  Command "/tmp/pip-build-env-x_mqgj_d/overlay/local/bin/cython;--version"
  failed with output:
```

This means **Cython is missing** and you need it to build the extension modules (`cmapping`).

Proceed to install Cython:

```bash
pip install cython
```

Then try building again:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

If successful, re-run:

```bash
pytest
```

to check test collection.
