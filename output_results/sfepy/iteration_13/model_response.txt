The build script failed with:

```
Problem with the CMake installation, aborting build. CMake executable is cmake
```

This means `cmake` is not installed and is required to build the extensions.

```bash
pip install cmake
```

Then re-run:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
and then rerun `pytest` if the build succeeds.
