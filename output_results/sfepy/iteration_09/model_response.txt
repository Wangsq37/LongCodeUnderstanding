The critical error is:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sfepy.discrete.common.extmods.cmapping'
```

This strongly suggests that `sfepy` depends on C-extensions (under `extmods`) which have not been compiled, likely because the project requires a build step (probably via CMake or setup.py/scikit-build).

Let's check for a build/install method:
- There is a `_skbuild/linux-x86_64-3.10/` directory, indicative of a scikit-build or skbuild-based build.
- There is no mention of `cmapping` Python, so it must be a compiled extension.

**Actions:**
- Look for build/config files (setup.py, pyproject.toml). 
- Attempt editable install to build C extensions if a build system exists.

Let's check for build system files first:

```bash
ls -l setup.py pyproject.toml
```
If either exists, install the package with pip in editable mode to build C extensions:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
After that, rerun pytest:

```bash
pytest
```
