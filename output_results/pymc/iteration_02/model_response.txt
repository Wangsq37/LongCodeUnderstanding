The primary error reported by pytest is not a `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError`, but a `pytensor.link.c.exceptions.CompileError` during compilation. The failing command is `/usr/bin/g++ ...`. This suggests that a C compiler (`g++`) or associated build tools (headers, etc.) may not be properly installed or configured in the environment. 

To resolve typical compilation errors for packages like PyTensor/Theano, we need to make sure build-essential tools are present (most notably `g++`). In a Python/Docker context, the minimum required is likely `build-essential`. 

Let me check for g++ and install it if not present.

```bash
which g++
apt-get update
apt-get install -y build-essential
pytest
```
