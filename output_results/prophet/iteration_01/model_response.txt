First, let's analyze the relevant dependency files and target the main test suite.

## 1. Locate Dependency Files

Observing the structure, the main Python code and tests reside in `python/prophet` and its subdirectories. There are two key subprojects:
- `python/prophet` with tests in `python/prophet/tests`
- `python_shim/fbprophet` (older? shim) with tests in `python_shim/fbprophet/tests`

Dependency management files for these:
- `python/pyproject.toml`
- `python/setup.py`
- `python_shim/requirements.txt`
- `python_shim/setup.py`

To focus, we'll use the standard install method for the main package (`python` directory) which hosts the primary Prophet implementation.

## 2. Install Dependencies

I will install with the following priority:
- If `pyproject.toml` exists, attempt PEP 517 build dependencies (`pip install .`)
- Fall back to `setup.py` (`pip install .`)
- Install extras if necessary.
- If any `ModuleNotFoundError` occurs, install missing packages with `pip install <package>`.

Let's proceed:

```bash
pip install -e python
pytest python/prophet/tests
```

If any import errors occur, I will install missing packages explicitly and re-try until test collection succeeds.
