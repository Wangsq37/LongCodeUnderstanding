The output `No call chains were recorded. (Hint: Check SOURCE_DIRS_TO_TRACK in conftest.py)` suggests that the structure may require tracking a submodule, such as `fiona.fio` rather than just `fiona`. Given `fiona/fio/` contains many scripts/utilities used by the CLI and tests, it's likely most actionable code is there.

To ensure we cover both the top-level package and its important submodule for tracing, update the config accordingly:

```file:conftest.py
SOURCE_DIRS_TO_TRACK = ['fiona', 'fiona/fio']
```

```bash
pytest
```
