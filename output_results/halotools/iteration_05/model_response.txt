The project contains both a `setup.py` and a `pyproject.toml`, suggesting it uses standard setuptools/Cython build processes.  
Given the presence of `.pyx` files and that test collection fails, a build step is required to compile extension modules (so that `import ...` works and pytest can run).

The correct next step is to install the package in development mode, which builds Cython extensions and enables in-place testing:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
After this, I will rerun `pytest` to check if test collection completes successfully.
