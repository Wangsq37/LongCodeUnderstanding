The error message states:

```
ERROR: Package 'halotools' requires a different Python: 3.10.12 not in '>=3.11'
```

This means the installed Python interpreter is 3.10.12, but the package requires Python 3.11 or newer as specified in its metadata. Since I cannot upgrade the Python interpreter inside the container, and all other approaches would also require Python >=3.11, I am unable to proceed.
