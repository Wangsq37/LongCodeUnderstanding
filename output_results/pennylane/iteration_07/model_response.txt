The errors shown are not generic `ModuleNotFoundError`, but mostly `ImportError` and `AttributeError` regarding the `pennylane` package (e.g., `cannot import name 'AutoGraphWarning' from 'pennylane.exceptions'`, `module 'pennylane.labs.resource_estimation' has no attribute 'ResourceTwoQubitComparator'`, etc).

This usually happens when the installed Pennylane version does not match the expected codebase of the repo's tests: the tests expect a local version, but the installed Pennylane comes from PyPI (global site-packages). The repo's code has likely been updated, while the installed package is older or from a different branch.

**The solution is to install the repo's version of Pennylane in "editable" mode (which will also install any dependencies).**

I'll look for the main Pennylane directory and its install metadata. From the error path `/app/repo_to_process/pennylane/devices/tests/conftest.py`, it is clear that the main package in this repo is `pennylane`.

**Next step:** Install the repo's `pennylane` in editable mode.  

Also, install extra requirements if they're listed in `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, or `pyproject.toml`.

```bash
pip install -e .[all]
```

If this fails due to extras, fall back to:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
and then try again.
