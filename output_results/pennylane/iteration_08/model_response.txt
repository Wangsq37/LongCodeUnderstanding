The project's `pennylane` package explicitly requires Python >=3.11, but the current environmentâ€™s Python version is 3.10.12. All attempts to install the package in editable mode fail due to this version mismatch.

As a result, the local tests cannot run against the correct codebase, and all subsequent collection or import errors from pytest will persist until Python >=3.11 is available.
