The error is `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pymatgen'` in many tests.

Given the layout:
- Source code is under `src/pymatgen/`
- Tests are in `tests/` and in `dev_scripts/chemenv/`

This means the editable install for `pymatgen` (from `src/`) is not working, likely because the installation step `pip install .` failed previously. The error in the install log above was due to a build or setup issue, possibly related to Cython extensions or other build dependencies.

Since the source is in `src/`, let's try a direct editable install, which works even if the wheel build fails:

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest
```
If this does not resolve the issue, I will investigate the specific wheel build or extension errors.
