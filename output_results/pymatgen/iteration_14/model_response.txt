The pytest output shows that test collection runs successfully, listing test cases without any `ERROR collecting`, `ModuleNotFoundError`, or `ImportError`.

**Status of Phase 1:**  
âœ… Test collection is working and pytest is able to discover all tests.

**Next Steps:**  
As the Phase 1 success condition is met, I am ready to begin Phase 2 (Call Chain Tracing).

If you wish to proceed, let me know and I will begin source directory identification and set up `conftest.py`.
