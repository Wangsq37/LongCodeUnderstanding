The output from `pytest --ignore=tests/io/jdftx` shows that tests are now running and being collected:

- There is a sequence of dots (for passing tests), x's (for expected failures), and s's (for skipped tests).
- There is no longer any `ERROR collecting ...`, `ModuleNotFoundError`, or `ImportError`.
- The test collection phase is successful.

**Phase 1 is now complete.**

Proceeding to Phase 2: Call Chain Tracing.

---

**For Phase 2 - Identify source directories:**  
The main Python source code is in:  
```
src/pymatgen/
```
So the source directory to trace is `src/pymatgen`.

Create the minimal required critical line for `conftest.py`:

```file:conftest.py
SOURCE_DIRS_TO_TRACK = ['src/pymatgen']
```

Now run `pytest --ignore=tests/io/jdftx` again so the call tracing/conftest plugin runs.
