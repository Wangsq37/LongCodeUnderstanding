The previous `pytest` command timed out after 3600 seconds, and did not provide module import errors, collection errors, or even a test collection summary (`collected X items`). This means the following:
- We do NOT know yet if collection errors or import errors are present.
- The pytest run was likely extremely slow, possibly due to the large size and complexity of the repository.

**Let's try again with a faster, more targeted collection check:**
- Run pytest in "collect-only" mode which avoids running tests and only performs collection, making it much faster.
- If there are import errors or collection errors, they will show up.
- If there are none and we see `collected X items`, Phase 1 will be complete!

```bash
pytest --collect-only
```
