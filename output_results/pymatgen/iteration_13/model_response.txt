The most recent pytest run did not report any immediate `ERROR collecting`, `ImportError`, or `ModuleNotFoundError`. Instead, the command timed out after 3600 seconds (1 hour).

**Diagnosis:**
- This is not a test collection error; rather, pytest may be collecting/running a very large number of tests, or there is an infinite loop/hanging test somewhere, or heavy resource usage.
- The move of the problematic `jdftx_disabled` directory out of `tests/` is correct.
- If test collection were failing, pytest would have quickly printed error blocks. Since the output shows only a timeout, actual collection may be working.

**Next Step:**
Let's check whether test discovery works with a quick dry run or a limited scope to see how many tests are present (and to verify it isn't hanging due to some problematic test or misconfiguration).

### Restrict pytest to only collect (not run) tests to check collection speed:
```bash
pytest --maxfail=1 --collect-only -q
```

This will:
- Only collect tests (not execute).
- Stop after the first error (if any).
- Provide a quick list of test items discovered.
- If this takes a long time, the issue is likely with massive number of files; if it produces output quickly, the problem is with test execution.

If the collection phase works, we may proceed. If there are errors, we'll address them next.
