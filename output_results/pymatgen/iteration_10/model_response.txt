The `pytest --collect-only` output shows a long listing of discovered test functions/classes and does NOT show `ModuleNotFoundError`, `ImportError`, or any `ERROR collecting test`. This means:

- Test collection has succeeded.
- No import or collection errors are present.

The summary line at the end is omitted due to output truncation, but the presence of many discovered test cases demonstrates that pytest is collecting tests as required.

**Phase 1 is now complete. I am ready to proceed to Phase 2.**

### Next step:
- Determine the source code directory or directories to track for call chain analysis.

Based on the project structure, the main source code is in `src/pymatgen`.

I will create a `conftest.py` in the project root with:

```file:conftest.py
SOURCE_DIRS_TO_TRACK = ["src/pymatgen"]
```

After this, I will run `pytest` again to generate the call chain reports.

```bash
pytest
```
