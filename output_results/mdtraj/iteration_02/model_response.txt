The key error in your `pytest` output is:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mdtraj'
```

This is because the project requires Python >= 3.11, but you are running Python 3.10.12:

```
ERROR: Package 'mdtraj' requires a different Python: 3.10.12 not in '>=3.11'
```

As a result, installing the package (and hence making `mdtraj` available) is not possible with the current Python version.

I cannot resolve this in the current environment.
