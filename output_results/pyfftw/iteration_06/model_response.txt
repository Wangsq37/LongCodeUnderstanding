The build output does not show any fatal error yet, but the full log is truncated. The next step is to check if the `pyfftw` extension module was successfully built, and then try running `pytest` to see if test collection succeeds, or if further dependencies are missing.

I'll run `pytest` now:

```bash
pytest
```
