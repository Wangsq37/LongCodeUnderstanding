Cython is now installed. The previous build attempt failed because Cython was missing. Next, I need to build the package so that the Cython extension (`pyfftw.pyx` â†’ `pyfftw.pyfftw`) is compiled and available to import during testing.

I'll run the build command again:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
