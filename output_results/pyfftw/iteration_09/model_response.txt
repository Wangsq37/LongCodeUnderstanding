The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyfftw.pyfftw'` persists.

After running `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`, the dynamic module (`pyfftw.pyfftw.so` or similar) still does not appear in the `pyfftw/` directory.

This suggests the build is failing to produce the required C extension. Most likely cause: **missing FFTW development libraries (`libfftw3-dev`, `libfftw3-omp-dev`), or compiler/linker issues.**

The repo also has `bin/ci/linux_install_libfftw.sh`, which likely installs these dependencies for CI. Let's inspect that script and attempt to install FFTW dev libraries manually since typical usage is `apt-get install libfftw3-dev libfftw3-omp-dev`.

```bash
cat bin/ci/linux_install_libfftw.sh
apt-get update
apt-get install -y libfftw3-dev libfftw3-omp-dev
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
ls pyfftw/ | grep pyfftw
pytest
```
