The core error persists:  
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyfftw.pyfftw'`  
- This means the Cython extension `pyfftw/pyfftw.{so,pyd}` was NOT successfully built.  
- After the build, `ls pyfftw/ | grep pyfftw` consistently shows only `.c`, `.pxd`, `.pyx` (NO `.so`).  
- The extension is missing, so any import of `from .pyfftw import ...` fails.

### Typical reasons for Cython extensions not being built:
1. **Cython is not installed.**  
2. Build errors are suppressed or redirected, or setup directives are incorrect for PEP 517 projects.
3. Misconfigured setup or missing dependencies detected via `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, or `pyproject.toml`.

### Diagnostics
- There is no `requirements.txt`, so that step failed.
- The build log does NOT show explicit Cython usage (no `cythonizing`, no `.c` generation, only attempts to compile whatâ€™s already there).
- The project directory contains `.pyx` files, which require Cython for compiling.
- Most scientific packages with C extensions (especially a pyfftw fork) require `Cython` for in-place builds.

### Next step:  
Install `cython` via pip, then try build again!

```bash
pip install cython
python setup.py clean --all
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
ls pyfftw/ | grep pyfftw
pytest
```

This should trigger proper extension build and resolve the import errors.
