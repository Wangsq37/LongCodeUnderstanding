The error is still `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyfftw.pyfftw'`, indicating the C-extension has not been built. This is a Cython .pyx extension, so the build requires Cython to generate the C file from `pyfftw.pyfftw.pyx`. Even if `pyfftw.c` is present, Cython may need to be installed for a fresh build matching your Python version.

Letâ€™s install Cython and retry the build:

```bash
pip install cython
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
ls pyfftw/ | grep pyfftw
pytest
```
