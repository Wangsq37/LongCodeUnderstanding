The error persists:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyfftw.pyfftw'
```

Despite successfully installing `libfftw3-dev`, the editable pip install still fails to build the Cython extension properly. This is confirmed by:

```
WARNING:root:file pyfftw.py (for module pyfftw) not found
...
error: Could not find the FFTW header 'fftw3.h'
```

However, checking your directory tree now, you have:

  pyfftw/pyfftw.c
  pyfftw/pyfftw.pyx
  pyfftw/pyfftw.pxd

These are the Cython sources required, but it appears the build may not have run or installed the extension correctly via pip.

Let's attempt a direct build for the extensions, falling back to a legacy method:

### Steps:
1. Try to build the extension *in-place* using setuptools.
2. Then, install the package (non-editable mode).
3. Then retry `pytest`.

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
pip install .
pytest
```
If errors persist, I will attempt to debug further.
