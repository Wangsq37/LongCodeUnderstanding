The core issue is that the build requires the PROJ system dependency, which cannot be installed due to missing apt packages and upstream repository issues in this container.

Attempts to build the package fail with:
```
proj executable not found. Please set the PROJ_DIR variable.
```
Attempts to run tests fail with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyproj._context'
```
This means the C extensions are not built, as the build system's requirements are not being satisfied due to the missing system libraries and binaries.

**Since the system packages cannot be installed and the repo cannot build/cannot proceed**, this situation is not resolvable under the current environment. There's no more pip-only step that would help.
