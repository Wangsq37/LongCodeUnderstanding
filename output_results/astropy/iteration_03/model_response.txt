The error is:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'Self' from 'typing' (/usr/lib/python3.10/typing.py)
```
The `Self` type was added to Python's `typing` module in version 3.11. Your environment uses Python 3.10, which is incompatible with this code.

You previously attempted to install the project and hit:
```
ERROR: Package 'astropy' requires a different Python: 3.10.12 not in '>=3.11'
```
This confirms the project's code and dependencies require Python >=3.11, but the container has Python 3.10.

**This environment cannot support this codebase.**
