The error messages indicate `ImportError` for modules such as `_bbox`, `_convolve`, `_distance`, etc. These are C++ extension modules that need to be built/installed. This is a common situation for packages with C/C++ extensions, and simply installing Python dependencies is not enough. The error message also hints at this:

> "the most common one is that you have either not built the packages ... Try installing and then changing to another directory before importing mahotas."

So, we must build and install the package before running tests. Generally, we'd run:
```bash
pip install .
```
or, if editable is needed for development:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

Let's install the package, then try `pytest` again.

```bash
pip install .
pytest
```
