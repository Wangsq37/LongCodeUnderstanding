The build failed because of a missing header file:

```
mahotas/numpypp/numpy.hpp:10:10: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
```

This means that the Python development headers are not installed. For Python 3.10, the appropriate package is `python3.10-dev` (or on some systems, `python3-dev` for the currently active version). In a Debian/Ubuntu-based docker, you install this with `apt-get`.

Let's install the development headers and try again.

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3.10-dev
pip install .
pytest
```
