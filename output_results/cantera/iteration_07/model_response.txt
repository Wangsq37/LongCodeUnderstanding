The output confirms the critical Cantera extension module `cantera/_cantera` is missingâ€”there is only the `.pyx` source, no compiled `.so` or `.pyd` file.

This is because, for Cantera, you must build the entire project (not just Cython) using SCons (`./SConstruct`) at the root. This step builds the C++ core, shared library, and Cython wrappers.

**Next, attempt a project-wide build using SCons, which should produce the critical shared libraries.**

```bash
scons build python
```

After this step, if the build is successful, re-run the test build and/or `pytest` as appropriate.
