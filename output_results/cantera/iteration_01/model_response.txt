```bash
# First, check for main Python dependency files in the likely interface directory
ls interfaces/cython/
# Check for requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, setup.py, etc., in common Python-related locations, especially interfaces/cython
ls interfaces/cython/pyproject.toml
ls interfaces/cython/requirements.txt
ls interfaces/cython/setup.py

# Check if there is a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml in the repo root as well
ls requirements.txt
ls pyproject.toml
ls setup.py

# Examine test/python subdirectory for special test requirements
ls test/python/

# Install cython interface and any possible test dependencies, as these files appear to be the primary Python code base, and tests live in test/python/
pip install -e interfaces/cython

# Try: requirements.txt or test-specific install if any is found
if [ -f interfaces/cython/requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r interfaces/cython/requirements.txt; fi

# Now, try running pytest in the main test directory
pytest test/python
