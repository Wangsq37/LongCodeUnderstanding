# The previous build attempt was executed incorrectly: it tried to run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` from the wrong directory.
# The correct location for `setup.py` is likely `interfaces/cython/`, as inferred from typical Cantera layout and the presence of `cantera` package code there.
# Let's list the contents of `interfaces/cython/` to confirm the presence of `setup.py`, then run the build command from within that directory.

```bash
ls interfaces/cython
cd interfaces/cython
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
cd ../..
pytest test/python
```
