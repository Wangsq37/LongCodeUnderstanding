# The error is: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cantera._cantera'
# This typically means the binary extension._cantera is missing (not built),
# likely this package requires building Cython/C/C++ extensions 

# Try to build the Cython extension module manually using setup.py.
# (If pyproject.toml is present, but editable install sometimes misses binary .so builds.)
pip install cython numpy  # common build dependencies

cd interfaces/cython
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
cd ../..

# Try pytest again, as the binary should now exist.
pytest test/python
