The error is clear: `scons` is not installed. You must install it in order to build the Cantera core and Python extension modules.

```bash
pip install scons
```

Once `scons` is installed, repeat the build command:

```bash
scons build python
```
After a successful build, you should proceed with running `pytest` again to check for collection errors.
