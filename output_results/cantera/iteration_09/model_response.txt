The last command used was:
```bash
scons build python
```
But the error is:
```
ERROR: Unrecognized command line target: 'python'
```
This means the SCons script for this project does not accept `python` as a target in this way.

### What to do next:
Let's try running SCons with no target to see what default targets are available and whether it can build the Python extension by default.

```bash
scons
```

If this does not display useful output, try:
```bash
scons --help
```

After this, we can decide how to proceed with the environment setup before running `pytest`.
