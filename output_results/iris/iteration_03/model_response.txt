The error shown is:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'iris.std_names'
```

Looking at the directory structure under `lib/iris/`, there is no `std_names.py` file present. This is not a missing dependency to install via pip; it is a missing source file.

**Root Causes:**
- The package expected to find `iris/std_names.py`, but it does not exist, or possibly a file such as `std_names.py` was removed or misplaced.

**What to try:**
- Check if there is a file named something like `std_names.py` or `std_names` in the repository but in the wrong location, for example, in an `etc/` or `data/` directory.
- See if there is a generation step or script that should create this file (e.g., as part of a build, or from data in `etc/cf-standard-name-table.xml`).
- Check for submodules, documentation, or manifest files referencing it.

If none of these exist, and the source simply isn't there, this can't be fixed in this environment without source modification or instructions from upstream.

**Let me check for a likely file or pointer before declaring failure.**

```bash
find . -name "std_names*"
```
