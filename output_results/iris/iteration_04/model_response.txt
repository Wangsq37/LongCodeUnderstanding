The file or module `iris.std_names` does not exist anywhere in the repo, as confirmed by the `find` command and the full directory structure. There is no `std_names.py` or relevant subdirectory.

This is a missing core source file, not a pip-installable dependency. The code in `lib/iris/common/mixin.py` tries to do `import iris.std_names`, but there is no such file or module present.

There are no indications of a generation step or a build script in the project structure. The only related files seem to be:
- `etc/cf-standard-name-table.xml` (possibly for standard name data), but no code or script exists that would generate `iris/std_names.py` from it, at least not visible in the repo.
- No `requirements.txt`, no `setup.py` (as far as the structure shows), and no `pyproject.toml` indicating this is an installable package that might have optional extras.

**Therefore, I am unable to proceed further. The test suite fundamentally cannot run as shipped, since an essential module is missing.**
