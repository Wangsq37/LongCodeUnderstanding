Both `pip install -e .` and `pip install .` failed during the build process, so the core package `statsmodels` is not available for import, causing `ModuleNotFoundError` in pytest.

This is a source build of `statsmodels`, which requires C/C++ compilers and potentially other build tools and Python dev headers to succeed.

Let's install the typical build-essential tools needed for Python packages with native code:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev
pip install -e .
pytest
```
If the install succeeds, pytest should be able to import `statsmodels` and proceed with test collection. If not, we will check for new errors.
