The error is: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'statsmodels'`.  
This means the core package is not available for import. The previous `pip install -e .` failed due to build errors, so the package was not installed.

Let's try installing the package in regular mode (non-editable) to see if that succeeds and if it resolves the import issue.

```bash
pip install .
pytest
```
