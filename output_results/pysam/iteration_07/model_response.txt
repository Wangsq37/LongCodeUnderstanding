The main source code directory is still `pysam`. 
However, your test run failed due to missing Cython extension modules (e.g., `libchtslib`). These must be built before tracing can occur.

If you cannot build or install these compiled extension modules in this environment, tracing cannot proceed.

Therefore, I must terminate:
```status
failed
```
