The `pytest` output shows repeated `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pysam'` for all test files. This means the `pysam` package is not installed in the environment as an importable Python module. The previous attempt to install via `pip install -e .` failed because of missing build files (notably `version.sh`) required to build the package.

There is a `htslib/version.sh` in the repo, but the build complains it can't find it (likely it's not executable, in the wrong path, or something else in the build fails).

Let's list the files in `htslib` and ensure `version.sh` exists and is executable, as some builds require it for generating version info. Then, if needed, make it executable and retry the installation.

```bash
ls -l htslib/version.sh
chmod +x htslib/version.sh
pip install -e .
pytest
```
