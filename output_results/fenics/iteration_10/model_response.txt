The situation is as follows:

- The `dolfinx` Python package must be built from source (it's in `python/dolfinx/`). The editable install of `fenics-dolfinx` fails, because the required dependencies in `pyproject.toml` (`fenics-basix>=0.10.0.dev0`, `fenics-ffcx>=0.10.0.dev0`, `fenics-ufl>=2025.2.0.dev0`) do not exist on PyPI.
- There is no released version of `fenics-dolfinx` available for `pip install fenics-dolfinx`.
- There is no `requirements.txt` (no easy way to patch just the dependencies).
- Because the source depends on unreleased versions of critical packages, there is no simple way forward.

Therefore, it is NOT possible to get `pytest` to collect tests due to the unresolvable dependency issues in this environment.
