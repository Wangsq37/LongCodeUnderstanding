# The error is not a missing Python module, but that no MPI library ('libmpi.so', etc.) can be loaded.
# This must be resolved at the system (shared libraries) level, not Python. Install OpenMPI to provide these libs.
apt-get update
apt-get install -y libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin
# Try pytest again
pytest
