The error persists: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dolfinx'`  
The attempted install of `fenics-dolfinx` (via `python/`) fails due to `fenics-basix>=0.10.0.dev0` not existing on PyPI (latest is 0.9.0), so editable install for dolfinx cannot proceed.

Before declaring failure, let's check if there is any `requirements.txt` or other install format in `python/` that can be used to force install or build, or if the Python package can work with lower versions of basix.

Let's look for a requirements file and try a plain pip install of `fenics-dolfinx` to get any binary or older version, and/or see if dropping or editing the version spec in `python/pyproject.toml` can help.

```bash
ls python/
ls python/dolfinx/
ls python/demo/
cat python/pyproject.toml
cat python/requirements.txt  # if exists
pip install fenics-dolfinx
```
(If pip install fenics-dolfinx succeeds, retry pytest.)
