```bash
# 1. Install dependencies from requirements/build files in likely Python test source directory
pip install -r python/build-requirements.txt || true
# Some projects may rely on pyproject.toml as well, so attempt installing via that (ignoring build isolation for speed)
pip install -e ./python

# 2. Run pytest. Primary tests likely in python/test/unit, but default root run covers everything.
pytest
