```bash
# The error says "Could not find CMake with version >=3.21".
# Let's install cmake (latest version from pip, as apt packages are often old).
pip install cmake
# Then try the install again.
pip install --no-build-isolation -e ./python
# Try pytest after that to check if dolfinx import is now resolved.
