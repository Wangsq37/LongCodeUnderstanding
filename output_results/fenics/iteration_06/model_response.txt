# The dolfinx Python source is at python/dolfinx, but this directory is not recognized as an installable package root by pip directly.
# Instead, try to install the main python directory as a package using pip with the --no-build-isolation flag
# to avoid the fenics-basix version constraints that previously caused problems.
pip install --no-build-isolation -e ./python
# Then try pytest again.
