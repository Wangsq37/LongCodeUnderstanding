There are no clear test files or testable Python modules present in this repository (pytest collected 0 items). Thus, even if we set up call chain tracing for any plausible source directory, no call chains will be generated because there are no tests to execute.

Based on the project structure, the only plausible pure-Python module that could form a reusable codebase is inside `devtools`. All other main directories are either C++ sources, headers, documentation, or examples/scripts. 

However, since there really are no test files present, proceeding further cannot fulfill the Phase 2 success conditions.
