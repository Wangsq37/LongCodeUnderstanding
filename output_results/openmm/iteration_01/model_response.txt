```bash
# Explore wrappers/python for dependency files; it contains setup.py and is the likely main Python source.
pip install -e wrappers/python

# Check for requirements.txt or similar in wrappers/python/tests/ (not present above), so just try pytest in that directory.
cd wrappers/python/tests
pytest
```
