The pytest output clearly shows:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
```

Numpy was not installed because the previous pip install failed due to dependency conflict, so there is currently no numpy in the environment.

The next step is to install numpy, even if this means temporarily breaking some downstream packagesâ€”we need numpy for collection to proceed at all.

```bash
pip install "numpy==1.24.4"
pytest
```
