```bash
# 1. Install dependencies from pyproject.toml and environment.yml (if requirements.txt not at root)
pip install -e .

# 2. Look for a requirements.txt under doc/ and install those (it's the only requirements.txt listed)
pip install -r doc/requirements.txt

# 3. Try running pytest (entry point for test auto-discovery)
pytest
```
