Based on the project structure, the main source directories are:

- `_plotly_utils`
- `plotly`
- `codegen`

These house the bulk of Python source code that's tested.

```file:conftest.py
SOURCE_DIRS_TO_TRACK = ['_plotly_utils', 'plotly', 'codegen']
```

Now run pytest to generate the call chain reports:

```bash
pytest
```
