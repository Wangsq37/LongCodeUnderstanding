```bash
# Step 1: Find obvious dependency declaration files
ls -l requirements.txt
ls -l setup.py
ls -l pyproject.toml

# Step 2: Search for requirements files inside the repo (may be in subdirs)
find . -iname "requirements.txt"

# Step 3: Identify python test directories/code (to determine if there are pytest-based python tests)
find . -iname "*.py" | grep -i test

# Step 4: Try running pytest directly (see if there are any import errors, maybe tests/py in subdirs)
pytest

# Step 5: Install common scientific/test dependencies if pytest fails due to missing packages (will be inferred based on error output after first run)
```
