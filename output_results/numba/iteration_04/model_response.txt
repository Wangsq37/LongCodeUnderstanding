The build process failed because the required Python development headers are missing (`fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory`). This is required to build C extensions in Numba.

You need to install the Python development headers. For Python 3.10, the package name is usually `python3.10-dev`.

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3.10-dev
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
pytest
```
