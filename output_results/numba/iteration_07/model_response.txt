The core problem persists:

- Numba requires at least version 0.45.0 of `llvmlite`.
- The installed version is 0.44.0.
- Even when using the default `--index-url https://pypi.org/simple`, `pip` cannot upgrade past 0.44.0 (Python 3.10 is installed).

This means:
- There is no wheel or source distribution for `llvmlite>=0.45.0` for Python 3.10 on this system/PyPI.
- The Numba project will not function on this Python version with this base image and mirror combination.

**No further progress is possible without a compatible llvmlite version, which is a hard requirement.**
