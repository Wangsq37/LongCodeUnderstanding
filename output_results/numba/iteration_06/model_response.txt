The error is:

```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement llvmlite>=0.45.0 (from versions: ...)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for llvmlite>=0.45.0
```

This means the pip index you are using (https://repo.huaweicloud.com/repository/pypi/simple/) does not have compatible wheels/sources for llvmlite>=0.45.0 for Python 3.10.

Before declaring failure, try to install with the default PyPI index by disabling the mirror:

```bash
pip install --upgrade --index-url https://pypi.org/simple llvmlite
pytest
```

If this still fails, additional debugging may be needed.
