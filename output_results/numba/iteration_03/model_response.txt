The new error is not a missing dependency, but an ImportError inside the project: 

```
ImportError: cannot import name '_typeconv' from 'numba.core.typeconv' (/app/repo_to_process/numba/core/typeconv/__init__.py)
...
raise ImportError(msg)
E   ImportError: Numba could not be imported.

E   If you are seeing this message and are undertaking Numba development work, you may need to rebuild Numba.
E   Please see the development set up guide:

```

This is a typical "Numba development install" scenario. For Numba, you must run a build step to create extension modules (likely `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`). Let me try that step, and then re-run pytest.

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
pytest
```
