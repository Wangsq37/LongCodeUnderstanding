The `pytest` output indicates:

```
ImportError: Numba requires at least version 0.45.0 of llvmlite.
Installed version is 0.44.0.
Please update llvmlite.
```

The installed version of `llvmlite` is too old. You must upgrade `llvmlite` (typically using pip).

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'llvmlite>=0.45.0'
pytest
```
