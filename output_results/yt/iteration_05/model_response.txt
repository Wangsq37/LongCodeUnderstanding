The error is:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yt.geometry.selection_routines'
```

This error indicates that the import statement `from yt.geometry.selection_routines import GridSelector` has failed because the module `yt.geometry.selection_routines` could not be found.

Given the project tree, there is a `yt/geometry/` directory, but there is no `selection_routines.py` file inside it. This indicates an internal packaging issue: the required module is missing, misplaced, or misnamed.

### Steps to Debug

1. **Double-check the `yt/geometry/` directory:** Examine the files in `yt/geometry/` to see if there is a Python file that matches or if it is misplaced.
2. **Search for the existence of `selection_routines.py`:** If it exists elsewhere, it may need moving.
3. **If the file does not exist, check for legacy or renamed modules:** Look for any similarly named files.

### Next command: list the files in `yt/geometry/` directory to proceed with the diagnosis.

```bash
ls yt/geometry/
```
