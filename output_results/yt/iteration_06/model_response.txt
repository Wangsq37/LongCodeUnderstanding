The directory listing of `yt/geometry/` shows that there is no `selection_routines.py` file, but there are files like `selection_routines.pyx`, `selection_routines.c`, and `selection_routines.pxd`. This indicates that `selection_routines` is a Cython module that likely should have been built to produce a `selection_routines.cpython-<ver>-<platform>.so` shared object or at minimum a `selection_routines.py` shim.

### Root cause:
- The import fails because the Cython extension has not been built, so Python cannot find `yt.geometry.selection_routines`.

### Next Steps:
- Check for a build system: `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`.
- Check for any existing build instructions (usually in `README`, `INSTALL`, or possibly in `tests/ci_install.sh`).
- Try to build the Cython extensions in-place.

First, let's look for a top-level `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` to attempt a proper build.

```bash
ls -l
```
If a `setup.py` is found, I will run a build command; if not, I'll look for instructions in possible documentation files.
