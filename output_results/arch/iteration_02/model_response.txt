The error is:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'arch._version'
```
This suggests that either `arch._version` should be generated during build or a file is missing. Often, `_version.py` is auto-generated by setuptools_scm or similar.

Let me try to generate the version file using setuptools_scm, which was installed previously.

```bash
python -m setuptools_scm
```

If this does not work, try to build the local package and install it in editable mode, which can also generate the necessary version files.

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest
```
