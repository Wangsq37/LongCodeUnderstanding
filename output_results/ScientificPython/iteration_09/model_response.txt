The errors have changed. Now the issues are:

1. **Syntax errors:**
   - `print c` and `print model.coeff` (Python 2.x print statement instead of print function).
   - `except ValueError, text:` (Python 2.x except syntax; in Python 3 must be `except ValueError as text:`).
   
2. **NameError:**
   - `NameError: name 'ModuleDeprecationWarning' is not defined` in `oldnumeric/__init__.py` (used by `Scientific/N.py`).

**Analysis:**
- This codebase is written for Python 2.x and currently being run on Python 3.10.
- All the syntax errors are due to Python 2-to-3 incompatibilities.
- `ModuleDeprecationWarning` was available in Python 2.x but not Python 3 (must use `DeprecationWarning`).

**Next required actions:**
1. Fix print statements in the affected files.
2. Fix exception syntax.
3. Patch `oldnumeric/__init__.py` to use `DeprecationWarning` if needed.

Let's start with the first listed file for each error for test collection purposes:

---

### 1. Fix print statement in `Scientific/Clustering/AffinityPropagation.py` and `Scientific/Signals/Models.py`
(Patch all occurrences of Python 2 `print ...` with Python 3 `print(...)`.)

#### AffinityPropagation.py:
```file:Scientific/Clustering/AffinityPropagation.py
# At line 306, change:
# print c
# to:
print(c)
# (Do this for all print statements in this file)
```

#### Models.py:
```file:Scientific/Signals/Models.py
# At line 346, change:
# print model.coeff
# to:
print(model.coeff)
# (Do this for all print statements in this file)
```

---

### 2. Fix exception syntax in `Scientific/Functions/Interpolation.py`
(Replace `except ValueError, text:` with `except ValueError as text:`.)

```file:Scientific/Functions/Interpolation.py
# At line 100, change:
# except ValueError, text:
# to:
except ValueError as text:
# (Do this for all similar try/except in this file)
```

---

### 3. Patch `oldnumeric/__init__.py` to define `ModuleDeprecationWarning` if missing.
Find or create the `oldnumeric/__init__.py` file in `/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/oldnumeric/__init__.py` (since that's where it's imported from). But as we cannot directly patch site-packages from here, let's instead address this differently:

If possible, install the compatibility layer for Numeric or Numeric itself for Python 3 (unlikely to exist), or patch `Scientific/N.py` to import `DeprecationWarning` instead, assuming `oldnumeric` is a local copy (but it's not).

**Alternative plan:**  
Let's see if installing `numpy` (provides Numeric/oldnumeric compatibility), or `scipy`, unblocks this.
So:
```bash
pip install numpy
```
Then rerun pytest:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest
```

If the error persists, we'll patch `Scientific/N.py` to fallback to `DeprecationWarning` for Python 3.
