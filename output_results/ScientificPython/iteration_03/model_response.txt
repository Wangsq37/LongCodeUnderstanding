The error is `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Scientific'` for all test files. This means that `Scientific` (the main source directory in this repo, not a pip package) is not present on the Python path.

Since `pip install -e .` fails due to a missing dependency (`wheel`), and since there is a `Scientific/` directory at the project root, I will add the directory to the `PYTHONPATH` and rerun `pytest`.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/app/repo_to_process
pytest
```
