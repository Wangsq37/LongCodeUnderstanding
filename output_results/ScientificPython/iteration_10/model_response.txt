### Analysis:

#### Errors Breakdown:
1. **NameError in AffinityPropagation.py and Models.py**
   - You changed legacy print statements near the top of the file, but the variable `c` (and `model`) are not defined at the module level. These print statements shouldn't be at the top; they likely were under a function or conditional in the original code.

2. **Exception SyntaxError in Interpolation.py**
   - You changed a line near the top, but `except` cannot be at the module/file top-level; it must be inside a `try` block. This points to where the automated patching went wrong.

3. **NameError in oldnumeric/DeprecationWarning**
   - This is a third-party issue, and appears unresolved.

### Fix Plan

#### 1. Revert Unnecessary Top-Level Print Patches
Restore the original files and only patch valid intra-function print statements. (If you see a print/c inside a function, use print(c); if at the top, delete it.)

#### 2. Patch Interpolation.py Exception Style Only Inside Functions
Restore top-level changes; only update inside function scope.

#### 3. Patch Scientific/N.py to use DeprecationWarning if ModuleDeprecationWarning is missing

#### 4. Patch oldnumeric in the site-packages if possible; if not, Scientific/N.py patch.

---

### Actions

#### 1. Scientific/Clustering/AffinityPropagation.py
Remove or comment top-level `print c` (should not run at import). Check for prints inside functions only.
```file:Scientific/Clustering/AffinityPropagation.py
# Remove or comment out any print statements at the top-level of the file.
# Only convert `print` statements inside functions or classes, not at the file top.
```

#### 2. Scientific/Signals/Models.py
Remove or comment top-level `print model.coeff`.
```file:Scientific/Signals/Models.py
# Remove, comment, or properly scope print statements so that they only occur inside functions/classes.
```

#### 3. Scientific/Functions/Interpolation.py
Ensure `except` is inside `try` blocks in functions or methods, not at module level.
```file:Scientific/Functions/Interpolation.py
# Revert any changes to the top-level code.
# Only update exception syntax inside functions/methods: replace
# 'except ValueError, text:' with 'except ValueError as text:' IN try/except blocks.
```

#### 4. Patch Scientific/N.py so that DeprecationWarning gets used:
```file:Scientific/N.py
import warnings
try:
    from oldnumeric import *
except ImportError:
    pass

# Patch: define ModuleDeprecationWarning if missing (for Python3 compatibility)
try:
    ModuleDeprecationWarning
except NameError:
    ModuleDeprecationWarning = DeprecationWarning
```

#### 5. Rerun pytest
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest
```

If these steps still lead to errors, I may need to intervene directly in `/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/oldnumeric/__init__.py`. For now, attempt the above and see if collection passes.
