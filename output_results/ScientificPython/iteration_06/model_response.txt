The setup.py expects the `wheel` package to be present, and tries to import `wheel.paths`. This caused `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'wheel.paths'` and failed the editable install.

The next step is to install the `wheel` package using pip and re-run the editable install.

```bash
pip install wheel
pip install -e .
pytest
```
