The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Scientific'` persists, indicating that Python still cannot find the `Scientific` directory as a module.

Since `Scientific/` is located at the project root, I should set the `PYTHONPATH` to include the project root itself (`/app/repo_to_process`), not just rely on a subdirectory.

Let's explicitly set the current directory as the `PYTHONPATH` and rerun pytest.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/app/repo_to_process
pytest
```
