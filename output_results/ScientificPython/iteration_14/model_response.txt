There is now an `IndentationError` in `Scientific/Geometry/VectorModule.py` at line 3.  
This is an error from the previous edit—likely extra indentation or malformed paste.

Let's correct the indentation: we'll restore the logic so that only the `__repr__` method is replaced, and with proper indentation.

Assuming the previous file originally defined a class (for example, `class Vector:`), the `__repr__` should be an indented method within that class.  
I'll rewrite only the concerned method, maintaining the rest of the file unchanged.

Assuming `VectorModule.py` contains a class (as the line reads `def __repr__(self):` at line 3, which should typically be indented to be within a class), let’s fix the indentation for that method only.

```file:Scientific/Geometry/VectorModule.py
# ... pre-existing code, likely a class definition like `class Vector:`

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Vector(%s,%s,%s)' % (repr(self.array[0]), repr(self.array[1]), repr(self.array[2]))

# ... rest of the file unchanged
```

Now, rerun pytest for test collection:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest
```
