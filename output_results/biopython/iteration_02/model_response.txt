The `pytest` output shows hundreds of errors, all of which are:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Bio'
```

This means the `Bio` package (the actual repo's source code) is not being found by Python when running tests. This is almost certainly because the package is not installed (the `pip install .` failed to build the wheel), and it wasn't installed in "editable" mode. Alternatively, the source tree layout may not be standard (`Bio` is a top-level directory, not inside `src/`), so we need to make sure `Bio` is importable.

**Correct solution:**  
Install the package in "editable" mode using `pip install -e .` (this will allow development and tests to find `Bio`). If that fails, add the project root to the `PYTHONPATH` for the current session.

Also, since `pip install .` failed with wheel errors and warnings about the `setup.py`, let's try both editable install and, if needed, set `PYTHONPATH`.

**Try `pip install -e .`, then run pytest.**

```bash
pip install --editable .
pytest
```

If the error remains, I will set the `PYTHONPATH` and retry.
