The critical error blocking the build and imports is:

```
Bio/Align/_aligncore.c:9:10: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
#include <Python.h>
compilation terminated.
error: command '/usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit code 1
```

This means the Python development headers (needed for building C extensions) are missing.

**Next step:**  
Install the Python development headers. For Python 3.10 on Debian/Ubuntu, the package is `python3.10-dev`.

```bash
pip install Cython
apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3.10-dev
pip install --editable .
pytest
```

If the above doesn't resolve import errors, I will fallback to manually setting the `PYTHONPATH`. But first, let's try installing the development headers and see if the C extensions build and `Bio` is importable.
