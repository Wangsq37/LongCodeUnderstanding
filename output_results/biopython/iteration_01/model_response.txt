### Step 1: Identify Dependency Files

From the project structure, we have:

- `setup.py` (root)
- Possibly other requirements files such as `ci-dependencies.txt`
- Potentially dependencies listed in `.circleci/requirements-sphinx.txt`

Let's start by looking at the main ones for local/test/dev: `setup.py` and `ci-dependencies.txt`.

Assuming `setup.py` is the canonical source, but it could be a library (`Bio`, `BioSQL`) - so also inspect `ci-dependencies.txt`.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

We'll need to:

- Install the package (likely `pip install .`)
- Install anything extra from `ci-dependencies.txt`
- If tests fail with `ModuleNotFoundError`, install those packages as needed

### Step 3: Run `pytest` and Inspect

Let's proceed stepwise.

---

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .
pip install -r ci-dependencies.txt
pytest
```
(If pytest fails with import errors, we will install additional packages detected from the error output and rerun pytest.)

---

If the above completes with test collection, we continue to Phase 2. If errors remain, I will output additional commands to fix missing dependencies.
