There are no longer any `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Bio'` errors. All reported errors are now:

- `FileNotFoundError` for missing test data files (e.g., `"Emboss/alignret.txt"`, `"Blat/fasta_34.fa"`)
- `Bio.MissingExternalDependencyError` for missing things like `biosql.ini`, SQL schema files, or external tools/libraries (PAML, rlPyCairo, etc.)

These are not environment errors that prevent test collection. **Pytest successfully discovered and collected 2938 items, and only individual tests fail due to missing data or external dependencies.**

Phase 1 is now complete. Proceeding to Phase 2.
