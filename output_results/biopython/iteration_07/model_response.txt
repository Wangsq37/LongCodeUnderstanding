Phase 1 is already successful:  
- There was NO `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError` during test collection.  
- The only collection errors reported by pytest are due to missing data files or external dependencies, which do NOT block Python environment setup.  
- The test collection proceeds, `collected X items`, as required.

**Proceed to Phase 2.**
